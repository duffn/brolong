# Contributing to Bro Long

Thank you for wanting to contribute. There isn't much to say here as the project is very simple, but there are a few guidelines.

- Follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/duffn/brolong/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- I would certainly be interested in more [greetings and bros](https://github.com/duffn/brolong/blob/master/api/index.go).

That's really all. Thanks again.
